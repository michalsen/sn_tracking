SN Tracking for D8

Not a complete fan of this module, but it is a start.
Basically it is a custom block for tracking code, mainly Mongoose.

The reason for this, rather than add via code in the render array is so that
the SEO team, who do not (and will not have) code access can login and add
the code through the UI.

I'm already coming up with ways that are better than this module, but it was
a good exercise in D8 development for me.
